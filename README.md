Firefox user stylesheets automatic configurator<br>
#### Note:
The default style configuration is my custom styles built for the vertical tabs extension which will remove the horizontal tabs on top, as well as the window control buttons. It also includes a centering fix for the search bar when the favorites are disabled on the start page. If you do not wish this, please edit the styles files to meet your needs by forking this repository.

### How to use
* fork and clone this repository on your local machine
* edit the `userChrome.css` and `userContent.css` files to fit your custom configuration
* push these changes to your fork
* run the configuraton script
* reload Firefox

Now, you can automatically set up this configuration on any machine by cloning your fork on said machine and running the configuration script.
