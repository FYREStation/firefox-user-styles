# firefox-settings
My custom firefox userchrome settings. <br>
Note: This is specifically configured to run with the vertical tabs firefox extension, which will remove the horizontal tabs at the top of the browser, and everything above it. Feel free to use this, or edit the userChrome and userContent as you see fit.

### How to use
* navigate to the `about:config' url in Firefox, accept the warning
* search for 'toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets' and toggle it to `true`
* run the configuraton script
* reload Firefox
